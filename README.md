# DFA Simulator
A deterministic finite automaton (DFA) simulator written in Java. The simulator reads a DFA from the user and processes the strings inputed to determine if the strings are accepted by the DFA.

## How to use
1. Compile the source code
```bash
javac Main.java
```

2. Run the simulator
```bash
java Main
```

3. Input the DFA
Follow each of the instructions on the console to input the DFA.

4. Input the strings
Follow the instructions on the console to input the number of strings to be processed by the DFA. Then input the strings to be processed.

5. View the results
The simulator will output the results of the strings processed by the DFA after every string is inputed.
